# GeoEngine

My first attempt at a game engine, made with C++ and OpenGL 2, made as a final project for my computer graphics course in Fall 2023.

Includes an Entity-Component System architecture, .gltf model and texture loader, primitive shape raycasting and AABB optimizations.

## Instructions:

Controls:
 - Move around with WASD.
 - Jump with Q.
 - Interact with E.

To compile and run:
```
make

./geoengine.exe
```
